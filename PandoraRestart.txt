To deal w/Christa's sucky internet

- initially, state = IDLE
- songstart, duration => state = PLAYING
- stop => state = IDLE

on (re)enter to PLAYING
kill current timer (by process group)
start timer on songstart, to expire at duration + min(30s, duration/10)
  start new process group, sleep $expire && send restart pandora message
if no new message before that, restart pianobar

Also, on any interaction in the PLAYING state, check for existence of pandora process and that it has open TCP to pandora mediaserver:

   lsof -Pc pianobar | grep -c mediaserver.*pandora
